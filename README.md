## ðŸ“‹ How Sorting Works

### Exercise Organization
The app organizes exercises in a two-level hierarchy:

#### 1. Date Groups (Top Level)
- **Latest dates on top** - Today's workout appears first
- **"No Date" group at bottom** - Exercises without dates

#### 2. Within Each Date Group
- **Older exercises on top** - First exercise added to that date appears first
- **Newer exercises at bottom** - Recently added/moved exercises appear last

### Use Case: Daily Routine
Perfect for tracking a routine with the same date:

```
ðŸ“… 2024-02-15
â”œâ”€â”€ 1. Bench Press (added first)
â”œâ”€â”€ 2. Squats (added second)  
â”œâ”€â”€ 3. Deadlifts (added third)
â””â”€â”€ 4. Pull-ups (added last)

ðŸ“… 2024-01-15
â”œâ”€â”€ 1. Running
